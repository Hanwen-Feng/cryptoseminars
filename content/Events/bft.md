**Spekaer:** [**Dr.Qiang Tang**](https://alkistang.github.io/) ![Title]({static}/images/qiangTwitter.png#float-right"camera icon") is currently a Senior Lecturer at the School of Compuuter Science at USYD doing research on cryptography and blockchain. From 2016-2021, he was an assistant professor at New Jersey Institute of Tech in the US and Director of JD-NJIT-ISCAS Joint Blockchain Lab. Before join NJIT, he was a postdoc at Cornell. 

**Abstract:** An urgent demand of deploying BFT consensus over the Internet is raised for implementing blockchain services. The deterministic (partial) synchronous protocols can be simple and fast in good network conditions, but are subject to denial-of-service when synchrony assumption fails. Asynchronous protocols, on the contrary, are robust against the adversarial network, but are substantially more complicated and slower for the inherent use of randomness. We present Bolt-Dumbo Transformer (BDT), a generic framework for practical optimistic asynchronous atomic broadcast.

**Time:** Monday 4:00 ~ 6:00 pm, 19 Dec 2022
